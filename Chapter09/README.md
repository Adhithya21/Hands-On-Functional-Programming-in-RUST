This chapter makes use of Google's [cpuprofiler](http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/cpu_profiler.html),
which needs to be installed separately. It will not be installed through the normal cargo build process.

[GPerftools](https://github.com/gperftools/gperftools) is also available on Github.
